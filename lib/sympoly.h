 *  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_identities
 *  for math details of elementary symmetric polynomials,
 *  but we don't use their recursions because they are unstable.
 *  
 *  Based on an alternative recursion (on K):
 *      e_H(x_0,...,x_{K-1}) = 
 *            1_{H<K} && e_H(x_0,...,x_{K-2}) + x_{K-1}e_{H-1}(x_0,...,x_{K-2})
 *  to build values in situ in a vector or matrix.
 *  this recursion is more stable and allows a simple trick to
 *  deal with overflow.  If many x_k values >1, can get overflow.
 *  So instead we collect these together and run the recursion on:
 *  f_H(x_0,...,x_{K-1}) == \prod_{k=0}{^{K-1} (1/x_k)^{x_k>1}
 *                               * e_H(x_0,...,x_{K-1})
